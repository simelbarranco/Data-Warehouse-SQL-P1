## Project Requirements

### Building the Data Warehouse (Data Engineering) ⚙️

Design and implement a modern data warehouse using SQL Server that centralizes sales-related data to support analytics and data-driven decisions.

**Key Requirements**

- **Source Systems**: Load data from two operational systems (ERP and CRM) provided in CSV format.
- **Data Validation**: Identify, clean, and address data quality issues before performing analysis.
- **Data Integration**: Merge both datasets into a unified, analytics-friendly data model optimized for querying.
- **Data Scope**: Work exclusively with the most recent data snapshot; historical tracking is out of scope.
- **Documentation**: Create clear and accessible documentation of the data model for business users and analytics teams.
